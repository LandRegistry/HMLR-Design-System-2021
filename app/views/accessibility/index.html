          Accessibility by law
        </h2>
        <p>Accessibility is a part of several laws and standards we must follow. Each of the standards feed into the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/equality-act-2010-guidance">Equality Act 2010</a> and the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-sector-equality-duty">Public Sector Equality Duty</a>. If you are building anything which runs in a browser, you will need to meet the <a href="/accessibility-law/the-public-sector-bodies-accessibility-regulations-2018">Public Sector Bodies Accessibility Regulations 2018</a>.</p><p>If you are procuring hardware or software you will need to meet the <a href="/accessibility-law/en301549-accessibility-requirements-for-ict-products-and-services">EN 301 549 Accessibility Requirements for ICT products and services</a>. If you are working to the GOV.UK Service Standard you will also need to meet the <a href="/accessibility-law/accessibility-regulations-vs-the-govuk-service-standard">Government Accessibility Requirements</a>. </p>

          Best practice
        </h2>
        <p>
          Accessibility is a combination of good design and robust development. You can read some of the best practice documentation and see how you can apply it to your own work.
          
          Best practices are a guideline. They should remain flexible. You donâ€™t need to follow them strictly in order to benefit from them. You can use them to structure your own processes and find out what works best for your own team.
